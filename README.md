# position-quote
	Expecting to print in the format of ‘accountid : total account value’ total account value = sum of all individual symbol values for 
	that account individual symbol value for each account = nbr of shares held by that account in that symbol multiplied by the closing 
	quote price of that Symbol.

    Using the PositionSvc and QuoteSvc, retrieve all the positions and closing prices, then list each account ID with the total value of all 
    of that accounts positions.
         
    Can you output the accounts sorted by total value in descending order so that 8f7d928a is at the top?
